# Data Directory

This directory is used to store CSV files containing bikeshare data for the following cities:

- chicago.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- washington.csv

These files contain information about bikeshare trips, including start and end times, station and user information.

## Instructions:
1. Download the files from the [Explore US Bikeshare Project](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/May/6094a7cc_all-project-files/all-project-files.zip).
2. Place the CSV files in this directory before running the Python script.

Note: These files are large (approximately 30+ MB each) and are not included in the Git repository due to size constraints.

## Troubleshooting:
If you encounter a "File not found" error, ensure that:
- The CSV files are placed directly in this directory (not in subdirectories)
- The filenames match exactly as listed above
- You have sufficient disk space for the files

For any other issues, please refer to the main project README or open an issue on the project repository.
